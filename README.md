# Usability-Engineering-Portfolio
Due to academic policies, only my portfolio project containing the PDF for the PPT is displayed. This showcases the design justifications made during the creation of the final product (Figma prototype) for this course. The Figma prototype was created with several other groupmates. All credits due to the efforts made by others.
